                        Pig is a simple dice game first described in print by John Scarne in 1945. As with many games of folk origin, Pig is played with many rule variations. Pig is commonly used by mathematics teachers to teach probability concepts.<br>
                        It is a simple dice game which in its basic form is playable with a single die or double dice. You win by being the first player to score 100 or the defined winning points.
